> 📚 Personal library of scripts, configuration files, SQLs, and some extra handy stuff.

This repository is a collection of useful tools I use in my daily workflow — from shell scripts and PowerShell automations to Docker utilities and SQL helpers.
It’s a personal reference hub, built over time, and shared in case it’s helpful to others as well.
